PCE Messages
==============================================================================

Messages are used to control the emulator. They can be sent using the "m"
command in the monitor, for example

-m emu.disk.eject 0

will eject the first floppy disk. Message prefixes can be omitted, as long
as the message name is unambiguous (except where noted). The following
commands are equivalent:

-m emu.disk.eject 0
-m disk.eject 0
-m eject 0

A message has at most one parameter. If the parameter contains spaces, it
must be enclosed in double quotes in the monitor, like this:

-m term.screenshot "my screenshot.ppm"

	disabled. In all other cases the current PCM mode is not
	changed.

emu.tape.filter "0" | "1"
	Disable or enable PCM output filtering.

emu.tape.load [<position> | "end"]

	Disable or enable PCM mode.

emu.tape.rewind
	Move the read or write position to the beginning of the cassette
	file.

	position to <position>. If "end" is specified, move the save
	position to the end of the cassette file.

emu.tape.state
	Print the cassette state. Prints the current mode (load/save)
	and the current position.

emu.video.blink <blink-rate>
	Set the cursor blink rate. The number specified is the number
	of screen refreshes for which the cursor is visible/invisible.

emu.video.redraw ["0" | "1"]

	immediately, otherwise schedule a forced redraw at the next
	vertical retrace.
