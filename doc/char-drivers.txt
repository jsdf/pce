Character drivers
=================

The syntax of a character driver specification is:

<driver>:<option1>=<value1>:<option2>=<value2>...

White space around option names and values is ignored. If a value contains
a colon, it must be escaped by repeating it.


The following is a list of character drivers and their options:

null:
	log=<filename>
		Set the log file name.

posix:
	The "read" and "write" options are used only if "file" is not
	set.

	file=<filename>
		Set the input and output file name.

	file=-
		Read input from stdin, write output to stdout.

	file=--
		Read input from stdin, write output to stderr.

	read=<filename>
		Set the input file name.

	read=-
		Read input from stdin.

	write=<filename>
		Set the output file name.

	write=-

	write=--
		Write output to stderr.

	log=<filename>
